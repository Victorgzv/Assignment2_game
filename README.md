<h1>OOP Game Assignment 2016/2017</h1>
<ul>
<li>Assignment: Create a game in Processing</li>
<li>My game: Fruit Fever</li>
</ul>
<h2>CONCEPT</h2>
<p>I have called this game Catch the Frog. Inspired by the arcde game Ping Pong but in this case we control the movement of the ball instead of the trampoline platfrms
This game consists of six levels where you control a orange ball that bounces in 2 platforms, you need to hit as much frogs are possible in order to pass to the next level.
This game requires the player to carefully move skillfully around to catch frogs and power ups using A (Left) and D (Right).</p>

<h2>DESIGN</h2>
<p>The design of this game is very simple. The user is a simple orange ball and the points to score are green shapes that represent a frog</p>
<p>The player first sees the splash screen and after that the game screen.</p>
splash screen:
<p>This screen presents the name of the game followed by intuitive instructions that give the user an idea of how the works.</p>
<p>The powerups are presented in their actual color and it is described their functionality. I want to give the user and of how the power ups look like, and what the points(frogs) look like.</p>
<h2>CONTROLS</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A to move LEFT,D to Move Right</li>
		<li>Jetpack: Adds functionality to W to move UP and S to Move DOWN</li>
	</ul>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>Most class(Point,Big,JetPack and SlowMotion) extend the GameObject abstract class. This allows having some variables and methods that are common to these classes </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Player</h3>
The player(orange ball) is set to start at the top of the screen and
